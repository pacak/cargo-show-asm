## [0.2.33] - 2024-04-24
- Experimental support for disassembly, `cargo-show-asm` needs to be compiled with "disasm"
  feature.

  With that you can pass `--disasm` flag to disassemble binary artifacts (`.rlib` files or
  executables) created by cargo.

  To work with PGO, BOLT or other optimizations that require non standard build process you
  can pass path to binary directly with `--file`.

  For `cargo-show-asm` to detect symbols in your code you need to disable stripping by adding
  something like this to `Cargo.toml`

  ```
  [profile.release]
  strip = false
  ```

  At the moment interleaving rust source (`--rust`) is not supported
- bump deps

## [0.2.28] - 2024-01-17

        --all-sources         Show all the rust sources including stdlib and compiler
